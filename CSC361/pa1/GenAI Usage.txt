OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (September 26,2025 version) [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com/chat

I used generative AI for this assignment to understand some of the concepts that I didn't fully grasp at first. I had ChatGPT explain how best to parse URL's using urlparse, how best to parse and extract information from the HTTP response (using split() and strip()), and had it explain some confusing errors to me (such as getting incompatable data formats when making an HTTP request after checking if the server supports HTTP/2).
